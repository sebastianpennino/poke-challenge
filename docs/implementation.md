# Decisions and Implementation Details

## Tech Stack Decisions

### Why Remix?

I chose Remix because, in my opinion, it offers a more straightforward and intuitive development experience. It's easier to work with and makes code review more manageable, thanks to its clear structure and conventions. A more detailed explanation of what is remix and what I consider the main advantages [can be found here](remix.md).

### Why Prisma?

I chose Prisma for similar reasons as Remix; Its _convention-over-configuration_ approach makes integration seamless and straightforward. Prisma abstracts away the complexities of DB interactions, so I don't need to worry about writing SQL or even knowing the specific underlying database technology. For a more detailed explanation of how it works, you can refer to [this document](prisma.md).

### Why Tailwind?

Tailwind makes writing CSS a breeze. Its internal coherence in design decisions (such as colors and spacing), helps create a more polished and professional-looking app. While this can result in a more "standard" or "boring" appearance, it ensures consistency and ease of use. The DX it's also better since you can easily find examples to solve common problems.
